2. KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Best performing algorithm: DQN
   Achieved 0.966 accuracy

b) Action strategy analysis:

   Q-Learning:
   - Conservative strategy: trusts base model 94.4% of the time
   - Moderate DICT usage (4.0%): strategic oracle consultation

   DQN:
   - Conservative strategy: trusts base model 97.3% of the time
   - Moderate DICT usage (2.4%): strategic oracle consultation

   REINFORCE:
   - Conservative strategy: trusts base model 100.0% of the time
   - Low DICT usage (0.0%): relies on learned patterns


c) Tags most difficult to predict (lowest baseline accuracy):
   - X: 0.000
   - CONJ: 0.810
   - PRT: 0.912
     → Q-Learning improved to 0.941 (+2.9%)
     → DQN improved to 0.941 (+2.9%)
   - ADJ: 0.933
     → Q-Learning improved to 0.947 (+1.3%)
     → DQN improved to 0.947 (+1.3%)
   - .: 0.943
     → Q-Learning improved to 0.971 (+2.9%)
     → DQN improved to 0.957 (+1.4%)


3. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) When to use RL correction:
   - RL correction provides measurable improvement over base model
   - Most beneficial for error-critical applications

b) Computational considerations:
   - Baseline: Single forward pass (fastest)
   - RL agents: Additional decision layer (slight overhead)
   - DICT actions: Most expensive due to oracle consultation


4. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Current limitations:
   - Small training set (100 sentences)
   - Simulated DICT oracle (not realistic deployment scenario)
   - Universal POS tagset (coarse-grained)

b) Suggested improvements:
   - Train on larger corpus for better generalization
   - Replace DICT with realistic external resources
   - Test on domain-specific data (medical, legal, etc.)
   - Explore ensemble methods combining multiple RL agents
